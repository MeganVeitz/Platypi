# Platypi
Final Project consisting of Platypi evolving, mutating, and fighting off predators in their own world, for FRCC CSC_160 C++


## Foreground
This assignment is a continuation of Lab 8.
In Lab 8, you developed a class called platypus and tested it to ensure that it functions properly. 
In this lab, you will use that class in an environmental simulation.  

## Background
Mr. Burns does not care about almost anything ... but himself and his money. 
So, when his power plant leaked radioactive gooo that caused several species of wildlife to go extinct, he was only concerned with the public perception as it might affect his income and possible jail time. 
After the appearance of the three-eyed fish, Blinky, other rumors surfaced around the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. 
One of them is high concern over the mutation rate of the rare Springfield molted platypus. 
With barely more than 50 left in the wild, the word "extinction" has been tossed around. 
So, to quell the media, Mr. Burns had 30 of them captured, dissected, and analysed to check for signs of mutation. 
(Incidentally, Burns had 10 more caputured for dinner and to make hats out of. It turns out that Platypuses indeed make good hats.)
He found that the mutation rate is 2% each month, but when they do mutate, they become sterile and cannot reproduce. 
With this information, he wants to create one of those newfangled computer simulations that the press loves so much. 
That's where you come in!
